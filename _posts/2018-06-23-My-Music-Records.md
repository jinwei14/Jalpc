I like singing song when I am very bored. I am good at singing romantics songs however, most of them are

Chinese songs because I can understand the lyrics well. I also play acoustic guitar sometime. Hopefully I can perform

on the stage someday.

I like singers like:

* Ed Sheeran

* Jay Chou

* Eason Chan
